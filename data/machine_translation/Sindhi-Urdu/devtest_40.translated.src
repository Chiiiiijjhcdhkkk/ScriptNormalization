On the back of the sauna, humans find it difficult to maintain a digestive system to feed their own amino acids from the source of potatoes.
However, failure to do so has the consequences: growth, disease, food insecurity, and finally death.
The most readily accessible sources of potatoes are proteins that can be accessed in feathers and grains, but it's hard for us to digest the germ primates until they're cooked.
In fact, the food of these animals (frogs, mammals, reptiles) is not only easily digested, but also produces large amounts of protein, all of which must contain amino acids.
All things considered, we would not be surprised if our forefathers solved their "protein problem" in the same way as the Savannah chimps did today.
